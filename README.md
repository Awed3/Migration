In this project I investigated migration and it's mitigating effects on conflicts and adverse shocks. This is the code used for the project.
The thesis investigated if migration has a mitigating effect on conflict and adverse shocks on the remaining household members. Using a three-wave LSMS and ACLED panel dataset from Ethiopia, a two-stage least squares model with household and wave fixed effects was estimated. Migration was instrumented by the historical shares of migrants per district to address endogeneity (classically called a Bartik-shift), and a Least Absolute Selection and Shrinkage Operator was used for the selection of shocks.
For simplicity each component of the empirical analysis is separately built/shown in this repo. With a simple merge a final panel set that can be used to do the LASSO and 2SLS is possible, this can be found in either the LASSO or 2SLS section of the repo. All of the components can be combined into one big document and thrown into R markdown, if you follow the  order introduced in the repo.
